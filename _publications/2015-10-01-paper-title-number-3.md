Mobile air cleaners (MACs) have been proposed as a supplementary solution to combat the spread of respiratory aerosols in school classrooms. To determine which, where and how to use MACs, seven small- and medium-sized MACs were selected and assessed for different settings and configurations by 1) a decay test for determining the clean air delivery rate (CADR), and 2) a perception test with a panel of subjects, together with physical measurements, of noise and air movement. The findings show that to achieve the desired CADR (appr. 1000 m3/h for 30 students per classroom), the key factors are the induced airflow pattern and the location of the MACs. MACs with an upward air supply toward the occupied zone showed much higher CADR (max. 775–1332 m3/h) than those with a horizontal air supply (max. 219–333 m3/h). Moreover, using multiple devices simultaneously was crucial when the room size was increased, and combining mechanical ventilation could improve aerosol removal. Achieving a sufficient CADR would always lead to a noise level above the limit of 35 dB(A), yet sometimes the rating of the panel was more than 50% acceptable. The air velocities mostly fulfilled the requirement (<0.2 m/s), which aligned with the positive panel assessment. Hence, the evaluation by a panel of subjects can help to optimize the use of MACs in a classroom.
