excerpt: 'Very few airborne transmission studies exist in social settings like restaurants. Speech is not yet considered a major respiratory activity for airborne transmission. Risk analysis often ignores the respiratory flow from non-infected occupants. Most simulations use averaged flow methods despite the flowâ€™s turbulent nature. Improving the prediction of indoor flows can help minimise airborne transmission.'

As mandatory masking and social distancing measures decrease post-COVID-19, the risk of airborne pathogen transmission in crowded indoor spaces remains a significant public health concern. The pandemic highlighted the critical role of indoor air quality and ventilation in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases, underscoring the urgent need to improve our understanding and prediction of indoor airflow to minimise airborne transmission. In this review, studies on airborne transmission in indoor settings were systematically reviewed to identify research gaps and recommend changes in approach. The analysis is categorised into indoor airflow, dynamics of infectious respiratory particles (IRPs), and investigation methodologies. Findings reveal that almost 40% of the reviewed literature does not specify the type of indoor setting, with only 3% focusing on restaurant environments. Additionally, indoor air conditions are typically assumed to be constant, and respiratory activities are often limited to coughing and breathing. The review identifies the challenge of replicating the complex behaviour of IRPs in experiments and the computational expense of predicting turbulent indoor flows. Recommendations for future research include: i) focusing on social settings like restaurants, ii) considering varying air temperatures and humidity, iii) examining speech-related respiratory flows, and iv) employing visual and accurate tools to investigate particle-laden airflow. These insights aim to enhance public health guidelines and building designs to reduce the risk of airborne diseases.
