While the worst COVID-19 pandemic is past us and everything has almost returned to normal, we should act on the lessons learned and prepare for a future pandemic. Public places of large social gatherings like cafes, bars, and restaurants might be the most vulnerable indoor environments because the occupants face each other in combination with poor ventilation. However, little research has been done to study such a social setting. As an initial experimental study, a respiring manikin setup is developed to mimic face-to-face conversations between two occupants. This setup can mimic and visualize speech-like particle-laden flow in different environmental conditions. It has the potential to quantify the illuminated flow field for correlation with numerical simulations and be used with infectious viruses for virology studies in the context of airborne transmission.
