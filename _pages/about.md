I was born in Kolkata, a vibrant city in eastern India, but spent most of my childhood in the western provinces of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Growing up amidst such rich cultural diversity instilled in me an innate sense of curiosity and a constant desire to learn about the world beyond my immediate surroundings. This openness to explore and understand new things naturally extended to my fascination with flight, whether it was the sight of airplanes soaring overhead or the powerful rockets that carried humans into space. Those moments sparked countless questions in my young mind and marked the beginning of a lifelong curiosity about how things move, fly, and push the boundaries of what is possible.

My fascination with aviation, coupled with a love for physics and mathematics, naturally led me to pursue Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP). During my time there, I gravitated toward aerodynamics, captivated by its complex yet practical implications. A pivotal experience came with a summer training program at École Supérieure des Techniques Aéronautiques et de Construction Automobile (ESTACA) in Paris, where I got hands-on experience with industrial CFD software and visited renowned wind tunnel facilities at ONERA.

Back at IIT KGP, my passion for aerodynamics flourished further through research projects such as using active flow control techniques on NACA wings, aimed at improving aircraft efficiency and reducing their environmental impact. Although the COVID-19 pandemic limited my access to experimental setups, it directed my focus toward computational aerodynamics, broadening my experience with flight mechanics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and ventilation system research at Penn State University.

Choosing to deepen my expertise, I transitioned into an integrated Bachelor’s and Master’s degree, exploring diverse aerodynamic applications from hybrid rocket propulsion to vertical-axis wind turbines. A timely pivot occurred during the pandemic when I shifted from aircraft aerodynamics to studying respiratory flows—research that culminated in my first journal publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, marking a milestone in my scientific journey.

Motivated by interdisciplinary challenges, I now pursue my PhD at Delft University of Technology, focusing on the intersection of respiratory aerodynamics, indoor ventilation, and public health. My current research employs advanced experimental techniques and large eddy simulations (LES) to tackle the complexities of airborne disease transmission in indoor environments.
