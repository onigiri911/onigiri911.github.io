My name is Arghyanir Giri. I was born in the city of Kolkata in India, but have spent most of my childhood in the western provinces of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Since a very young age I have been fascinated by an airplane flying over the head, a loud sports cars passing by, and fast trains arriving at stations. This fascination drove inquisitiveness about how these marvels of engineering work. I knew exactly what I was interested in, and following my instincts I chose to develop a career in Aerospace Engineering.
